# Research Notes - Maritime Reservation System

## Ferry Booking Industry Insights

### Market Overview
- Over 200 shipping operators worldwide (source: Lyko Tech)
- 750+ ports globally with 1,900+ ferry crossings
- Major operators: CTN, GNV, Balearia, Corsica Lines, Brittany Ferries, DFDS
- Multi-operator API aggregation is standard practice

### Architecture Patterns
- Microservices architecture preferred for scalability
- API Gateway for traffic management and security
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB) for flexibility
- Serverless functions for specific tasks (notifications, image processing)
- Containerization with Docker and Kubernetes orchestration

### Technology Stack Trends
- FastAPI for high-performance Python backends
- React for dynamic frontend interfaces
- GraphQL for API development
- Cloud platforms (AWS/GCP) for comprehensive services
- CI/CD pipelines for automation

### Integration Challenges
- Multiple API formats and authentication methods
- Rate limiting and error handling
- Real-time availability synchronization
- Payment processing across different currencies
- Multi-language support requirements

## FastAPI Best Practices for Travel Systems

### Performance Optimization
- Asynchronous I/O for concurrent request handling
- Caching for frequently requested data
- Bulk data processing to reduce network trips
- Database optimization with indexing and connection pooling

### Security Implementation
- OAuth2 and JWT for token-based authentication
- Permission scopes for granular access control
- CORS management for cross-domain interactions
- Data validation with Pydantic models

### Architecture Principles
- Layered architecture (API, business logic, data access)
- Microservice independence with separate databases
- Domain-driven design for business alignment
- API versioning for backward compatibility

### Testing and Deployment
- Automated testing with pytest
- Docker containerization for consistency
- Kubernetes for scaling and recovery
- CI/CD pipelines for reliable deployments
