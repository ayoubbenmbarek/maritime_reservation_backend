## API Integration Patterns

### Aggregator Pattern (Lyko Model)
- **Concept**: Single API endpoint for multiple ferry operators
- **Benefits**: 
  - Unified integration approach
  - Standardized data formats
  - Reduced development complexity
  - Single authentication system
- **Coverage**: 200+ shipping operators, 750+ ports, 1,900+ crossings
- **Integration Partners**: Balearia, CTN, GNV, Corsica Lines, Brittany Ferries, DFDS

### Direct Integration Pattern
- **Concept**: Direct API connections with individual operators
- **Benefits**:
  - Full control over data and features
  - Direct relationship with operators
  - Potentially lower costs
  - Custom business logic implementation
- **Challenges**:
  - Multiple API formats and authentication methods
  - Different data structures per operator
  - Varying rate limits and restrictions
  - Complex error handling requirements

### Hybrid Integration Pattern
- **Concept**: Combination of aggregator and direct integrations
- **Benefits**:
  - Flexibility to choose best approach per operator
  - Fallback options for reliability
  - Optimized cost structure
  - Enhanced feature coverage
